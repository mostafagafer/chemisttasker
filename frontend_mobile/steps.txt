npm install -g eas-cli

eas login
npx expo login

npx eas credentials


Install/update deps:

npm install expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants (in frontend_mobile)
npm install -g eas-cli
Expo/EAS login:

npx expo login
eas login
EAS credentials (FCM v1 key upload):

npx eas credentials
(Android → development → Google Service Account → Manage Push (FCM V1) → Set up → Upload new key, selected chemisttasker-dd2ad-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-2747110cf0.json)
(Attempted and failed with old CLI): expo push:android:upload --api-key ./chemisttasker-dd2ad-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-2747110cf0.json
Builds:

eas build --profile development --platform android (dev client)
(Later rebuild with new FCM config): eas build --profile development --platform android
Running the app with dev client:

npx expo start --dev-client --clear (then scanned the “Development build” QR with the installed dev client APK)
Misc (auth/refresh):

npx expo whoami (optional to check login)
expo push:android:upload ... (deprecated/404 with old global CLI; replaced by npx eas credentials)
If you rerun on another machine: install deps, log into Expo/EAS, ensure app.json and google-services.json are in place, upload the FCM v1 key via npx eas credentials, rebuild with eas build --profile development --platform android, install APK, and run npx expo start --dev-client --clear to load the app.

when have we sat this mostafarg.chemisttasker and where?


We set com.mostafarg.chemisttasker when the EAS build prompt asked for the Android application id during the first dev build. After that, we saved it in frontend_mobile/app.json under expo.android.package so it persists for all builds.

Here’s a concise checklist you can save and use later to debug this kind of Expo + Django + mobile connection issue quickly:

✅ Expo Go + Django Backend Debug Checklist
🧪 1. Confirm Django Binding

Run:

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


Then check:

Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000

Expected:

LocalAddress should be 0.0.0.0 or your LAN IP (e.g. 192.168.1.9)

❌ If it's 127.0.0.1 → external devices CANNOT connect

🧩 2. If Django is not reachable from phone

Try:

python manage.py runserver <your-LAN-IP>:8000


E.g.:

python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.9:8000


Then check again:

Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000


✅ If LocalAddress is now 192.168.1.9 → it will work from your phone.

🌍 3. On Your Phone

In browser:

http://192.168.1.9:8000/api/


✅ You should see JSON or a valid response

❌ If not:

Ensure phone is on same Wi-Fi

Ensure no VPN or AP isolation is blocking LAN traffic

🌐 4. In .env.local

Set:

EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.9:8000/api


Then restart Expo:

npx expo start --clear --lan

🧱 5. Optional Fixes if Still Failing

Temporarily disable firewall:

netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off


Reset IP stack:

netsh int ip reset
netsh winsock reset
shutdown /r /t 0

🧼 6. Restore Clean Behavior

After issue is fixed:

0.0.0.0 binding will work again

You can go back to:

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
